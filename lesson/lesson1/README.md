### What You’ll Learn:  
1. **Understanding Square Roots**: Learn why equations like \( x^2 = 4 \) give \( x = \pm 2 \).  
2. **Imaginary Numbers**: Discover how \( \sqrt{-4} = \pm 2i \) introduces the concept of the imaginary unit (\( i \)), where \( i^2 = -1 \).  
3. **Complex Numbers**: Combine real and imaginary parts to form numbers of the form \( a + bi \).  
4. **Operations with Complex Numbers**:  
   - **Addition**: Combine real and imaginary parts directly.  
   - **Multiplication**: Apply rules, remembering \( i^2 = -1 \).  
5. **Complex Conjugates**: Understand conjugates (e.g., \( a + bi \) becomes \( a - bi \)) and their utility in simplifying calculations.  
6. **Applications**: Explore the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics, engineering, and real-world problem-solving.
